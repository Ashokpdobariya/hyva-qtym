# magento2-qtym

Qty manager  for Hyvä Themes

## What does it do?

It allows to use the standard qty another theme path for checkout when using the Hyva Theme
 
## Installation
  
1. Install via composer
   Note: both repositories need to be configured until the package and its dependency are available through packagist.
   ```
   
   composer config repositories.hyva-themes-magento2-qty git https://github.com/Ashokpdobariya/hyva-qtym.git
   composer require hyva-themes/magento2-qty
   ```
2. Enable module
   ```
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   ```
   
## Upgrading

After upgrading from release 1.0.3 or before be sure to run
```
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
This will ensure configuration settings stored in the database are properly migrated to the `Hyva_ThemeFallback`.

Should the configuration settings be locked in `app/etc/config.php`, you have to migrate all paths in the
section `hyva_qtym` manually to the path `hyva_theme_fallback`.  
The full paths that need to be migrated are:
```
'hyva_luma_checkout/general/enable'          => 'hyva_theme_fallback/general/enable'
'hyva_luma_checkout/general/theme_full_path' => 'hyva_theme_fallback/general/theme_full_path'
```


## Magento backend configuration

1. ```HYVA THEMES->Theme Fallback->General Settings->Enable```
    
    The configutation path is ```hyva_theme_fallback/general/enable```


2. ```HYVA THEMES->Theme Fallback->General Settings->Theme full path```

    The configutation path is ```hyva_theme_fallback/general/theme_full_path```
    
    default `frontend/Magento/luma`

3. ```HYVA THEMES->Theme Fallback->General Settings->The list of URL's parts```
   
   The configuration path is `hyva_theme_fallback/general/list_part_of_url`

## How does it work?

This module depends on `hyva-themes/magento2-theme-fallback` and only supplies the configuration.
